Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

Steganography explores ways of undetectably embedding secret data into other seemlingly innocent pieces of data (covers), without obviously / visually altering them. To achieve high embedding capacity and higher level of undetectability, it is advised to embed into files with high entropy and redundancy, where minor changes would go unnoticed. One such way is embedding into video files, specifically motion vectors -- numbers encoding changes in position of pixel blocks between frames. This project will explore feasibility of embedding data utilising motion vectors, develop a steganography program to do so (offering encryption of the data prior to embedding), explore ways such embedding can be detected (using recent research advances), attack other current solutions and investigate and use clever embedding schemes to mitigate potential attacks.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

Own laptop, for convenience.
