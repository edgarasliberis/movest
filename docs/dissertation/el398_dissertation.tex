\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate existing steganographic methods applied to motion vectors. To achieve this, an end-user tool should be developed to offer several steganographic methods. The algorithms will be evaluated based on criteria such as embedding capacity, speed, and detectability. A suite of steganalysis tools will be created.   

\section*{Work Completed}

Applications for embedding and extracting data from motion vectors were developed, featuring several popular LSB / image steganography algorithms. Matlab functions and scripts for steganalysis were created to extract and analyse motion vectors, offering classic and motion-vector-specific attacks against embedding schemes. Algorithms were compared against each other evaluating detectability, capacity and other aspects. Humans were used to evaluate detectability.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

None.

% Introduction
\chapterheader{1}{Introduction}

\emph{``Steganography''} is the art of concealing information within ostensibly innocent carrier data \cite[p. 3]{fridrich}, usually with the intention of creating a covert channel. Its applications include bypassing government censorship, avoiding law enforcement or military intelligence, and other situations in which detection of the communication may be harmful to the communicating parties (such as by revealing their location \cite{infohiding-survey}). 
 
\section{Motivation}

In recent years, steganography research has explored the use of digital formats carrier data. Often, redundancy in data formats provides opportunity for concealing a payload \cite[p. 2]{fridrich}. Since multimedia formats have become some widespread online, their use is now unremarkable and unlikely to raise suspicion.

A sensible approach to digital steganography is to hide data in regions of a file that are highly tolerant to small modifications or noise, such as by slightly changing the colour of a pixel in an image. Since the least significant bit in the binary representation of a value typically corresponds to the highest granularity level, changing it is less likely to be noticed---the key concept behind the so-called \emph{least-significant-bit (LSB) embedding} \cite{bateman}.

\textbf{TODO} The \texttt{MPEG} video formats, a de facto standard, encode a video stream as a sequence of frames. Since encoding every frame independently would be redundant, the similarity of successive frames is exploited where possible to store frames as a set of changes from their predecessors. These changes are represented by how much a certain block of pixels has moved (\emph{motion vector, MV}) and how, in addition to this motion, the pixels have changed (\emph{prediction error}). Frames encoded independently are called \emph{intra-frames} \cite{h264-std} (essentially a JPEG image) and those encoded as differences called \emph{inter-frames} \cite{h264-std}. While both hold potential as carrier data, we will be looking only at embedding data into motion vectors.

\textbf{PICTURE WILL BE GOOD HERE}

The amount of data one can hide using a steganographic system is called embedding capacity. Since videos are essentially sequences of frames with sound, we expect them to have the largest embedding capacity of all media containers. As there are typically $\approx$20 inter-frames per second and 1000-5000 usable motion vectors available per frame\footnote{Depending on the selection criteria and the resolution of a video file.}, we estimate an embedding capacity of $\approx$20-100 Kbits/s for MPEG videos.

To evaluate a steganographic algorithm, we need to determine if its use is detectable by an adversary. The study of methods of detecting steganographic manipulations is called \emph{steganalysis}. Steganalysts use various domain-specific statistical attacks, such as plotting histograms, looking for correlations (or lack thereof) in the data, etc. to detect the hidden message.

This project explores hiding data in the MVs of MPEG videos by applying LSB embedding to the $x$ or $y$ components of the vector. A tool was developed to offer several high-capacity data embedding algorithms and encryption with a user-provided password. These algorithms were evaluated based on, embedding capacity, speed, and detectability (using statistical steganalytic methods implemented in Matlab) 

\section{Existing work}

Traditionally, image steganography has received more research attention compared to video steganography, so early attempts tried to directly use existing image (JPEG) steganography techniques \cite{bateman, jpegdctcoding}.

Bateman \cite{bateman} reviews the evolution of LSB-based embedding algorithms. Simple strategies such as changing the intensity of every pixel are destroyed by the lossiness of JPEG compression when the image is recompressed. This can be mitigated by embedding data into something that JPEG stores directly in a compressed file, so later research focused on using the DCT coefficients for this purpose\footnote{
One of the main compression techniques that JPEG uses is \emph{Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)}, which is similar to the Fourier Transform. A relatively small number of coefficients is enough to reconstruct an image with sufficient quality. Those coefficients are insensitive to small changes, making they are suitable for data embedding.} \cite{jpegdctcoding}. Other approaches improve on this by preserving statistical properties that ``clean'' images would possess \cite{bateman, f5} (further discussed in \ref{emb-alg}). Similarly to this project, Williams \cite{scott-fs} applies these image steganography techniques to videos by considering uncompressed videos as series of JPEG-encoded frames.

Other researchers explored inter-frame steganography using motion vectors. Xu \emph{et al.} \cite{xu2006steganography} used the phase of an MV ($\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$) to determine which of the $x$ or $y$ component will carry a single bit of payload data (we discuss this method more in \ref{xu-alg}). Non-LSB algorithms include an interesting approach by Fang \emph{et al.} \cite{fang2006data}, who proposed to find an alternative motion vector (with minimum prediction error), whose phase will be in a particular quadrant out of 4. This conveys 2 bits of information per MV.

One of the main deliverables of this project is a simple tool for doing MV-based steganography. Popular existing stegongraphy tools, such as MSU StegoVideo\footnote{\url{http://www.compression.ru/video/stego_video/index_en.html}} or OpenPuff\footnote{\url{http://embeddedsw.net/OpenPuff_Steganography_Home.html}} do not implement MV steganography. so we will not discuss them further. The only implementation of MV steganography that I was able to find is James Ridgway's \emph{Steganosaurus} \cite{steganosaurus}, but its algorithm seems rather limited. It only modifies the first (presumably the top left) motion vector of every frame severely limiting embedding capacity and increasing the ease of detection (as the location of the modified MV is known).   

Discuss steganalysis.
